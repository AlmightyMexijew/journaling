After some chaos in the pre-Pesach(Passover) leadup I'm putting some time into this whole endeavor again.

Today we're going to throw some time and effort into HTML forms and understanding them. We'll be using the Vickler book to do so.

An interesting this is how the forms are set up. They work like div containers but they are full of attributes and ids that must match together.  We can set them up and provide values to them and correlates for backend. That is pretty neat.
