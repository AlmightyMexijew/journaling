Today's exercise is in CSS Margins and Padding. I've done this before in the The Odin Project and hopefully this will reinforce that.

At first glance, the initial project Vickler gives is simple. A div after an h4...but magically the div is centered relative to the page. It's not perfectly centered and the element is expanded far beyond the text but it gives off the illusion of centering.

Why is this?  I looked back at the code to understand why it's showing up this way and concluded the following: the margin is 100. We didn't specify what direction.  We're about equidistant from the h4 element as we are from the left "wall" of the screen.
