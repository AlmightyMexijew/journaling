Continuing where we left off:
The width feature. Adding width property can define how much width the HTML element will have. When defined, the padding is added to width, producing unexpected results.
See example padding3.html 
The first div is 400px and the second div is 350 but for whatever reason div2 is slightly bigger than div1 even.

In example 2 (padding4.html) a br tag splits the elements, leading to the proper visual effect of div1 being bigger than div 2. The only thing I wonder is whether the 50px made the difference between padding3.html and padding4.html. To test this, we created padding4a.html and adjusted to 350 like in the previous (padding3.html).

The results were the same. The break tag (br) was enough to differentiate between elements and regulate the size.
