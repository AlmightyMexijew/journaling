New day, new notes. This is what I managed to get done while my wife sleeps and I do productive things in the "nap time".  

We left off yesterday with the video at the point of setting a count for the bonus points and then adding to it and consolelogging it.

Today:
We're going to write out pseudocode procedures for our counter.

*Store count as 0
*listen for clicks on increment
*change counter in the html to reflect new count

So we're entering the HTML and we go add to the button the onclick attribute.  Very nice. We get an explanation of what exactly that is (he calls it event handler).  Inside the onclick we add a function ("increment()").

We also need to create the function in our JS script.
function increment() {

}

The code in between the curlies will execute every time function is invoked. So console.log("The button was clicked") brings every single time we click.

I actually love this idea because it helps us to understand that elements have attributes, in a meaningful and useful way that just rattling off doesn't do.  Very helpful.

Now we're discussing functions. Great. I think this is awesome and I wish we learned it sooner in TOP methodology.

"The Race Game"
5 console.log in descending order.
*go
*players running Race
*race finished
*get ready for new race.

--He says any time we need to repeat our code, we could make a function.  He says we can also call it a "command".

To create a function we need function and then a name with () and {}
function countdown() {console.log()}
with 5 : 1 in consolelog()

--Invoke/call a function makes it happen. Otherwise won't happen. We have to call on it to make it happen.

Our turn:
Create a function that logs out hte number 42. We can name it and we just call/invoke it.

function fart() {
    console.log(42)
}

I chose this magical name because why not..it's fun and that is how we get through programming exercises-- by having fun!

Now we have a new exercise: create a function that logs out the sum of all lap times

let lap1 = 34
let lap2 = 33
let lap3 = 36

function laps() {
    let lapTime = lap1 + lap2 + lap3
    console.log(lapTime)
}

He does this..but also says we can console.log(lap1 + lap2 + lap3).  He's explaining scopes now.

---
Time to combine things we've learned for the lap counter
Create a function that increments the lapsCompleted variable with one.  Run it three times.
console.log(lapsCompleted) at end.

Pretty simple. I see where this is taking us. We're going to implement this idea in practice to our train ticket system where we're going to be doing a similar concept by having a function that adds to the tally on button press..which we'll call from "onclick" probably.

Anyways here is my code and what I arrived at:
let lapsCompleted = 0
function lapUp() {
    lapsCompleted ++
}
lapUp()
lapUp()
lapUp()
console.log(lapsCompleted)
-----
Very good, we wrote even better than him.  He used count = count + 1
Very amateurish like he said with our poor embedding of script. Payback!!

Anyways...Here we go..Now to implement this in our app.
*we initialize count as 0
*lisen for clicks on increment-btn.
*increment variable when clicked
*change count-el in HTML.

So my guess is something like this:

let count = 0
function Increment() {
    count ++
}
....or count = count + 1 if we want the amateur way....
document.getElementByID("count-el").innerText = count
