Good morning Tuesday March 15.

Today we are starting a new chapter (chapter 2-- Javascript Variables). The notes are in vicklerpractice/vicklerpractice/ in the 2nd folder.
Unsurprisingly, example1.html fails....I'm not sure why but his JavaScript code isn't necessarily working.  It intends to change the paragraph #"variable-demo" but it doesn't succeed and previous incarnations of similar also didn't work. I will have to investigate this further to see if there is a missing element. Previous attempts I found could be alerted or console-logged but the actual invocation of document.getElementByID has significant issues.

An usual part of the book: he claims we can copy/paste the code.....and that he's going to embed in HTML always because "that is how you will write it when creating a website".  Bit unusual given that people can src a .js and it's very common practice from my personal observation.

Not having success with example2.html either it seems.  Confusingly, same method call worked just fine in datatype.html. See there. I honestly don't know what to make of that.  undefined.html failed. Redefine is a similar case but we were expecting anyways and vscode complains about it.

Math.html does work. This gets more and more mysterious every time document.getElementByID is invoked and fails more often than succeeds. In stringconcat.html we noticed an additional number of variable calls that had nothing to do with this page's dec. I cut them out and the script worked just fine as meant to.

Global scope is really really limited in explanation. globalscope.html worked nicely.
