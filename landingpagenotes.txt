Notes on video "5 Crucial Things Every Landing Page Should Have (with examples)". by Flux (youtuber).
The goal of a page is hyper-specific to make an action happen. In a business sense it's meant to boost conversion to sales.
Goal 1: Have a very clear value proposition. Explain what is in it for the client. If it's not clear or powerful they'll move on.
Goal 2: Call-to-Action that is very strong. Tell them what to do. Click, call,e-mail, sign-up, whatever. It's meant to be what we want to happen.
Goal 3: Keep them focused. Don't lose them in details, limit them.
Goal 4: Visual. Show them an image that explains what they'll get. What are they signing up for? Best images evoke emotion.
Goal 5: Social proof. Show example of who else uses it. Inherent biases will lead to people wanting to try. Logos/testimonials.

Example 1: Shopify.  Says "sell online with shopify". Call to action very clear. "Trusted by over 1 million businesses worldwide" == social proof. Another call to action "leave your e-mail, start your free trial".  Image is shop integration, analytics page, shopping cart logo from e-commerce.

Example 2: Webflow. No navigation. Value proposition "Break the code barrier -- build better business websites, faster. Without coding". Visual shows the website building and UI/UX stuff. Social proofing includes Facebook, CBS,Dell,MTV,etc. logos. Button for "get started it's free" as call to action.

Example 3: Netflix main page... No nav at top except sign-in for users. Value proposition "100% entertainment for *price* for first 30 days. Watch anywhere, cancel anytime."   Big subscribe button and signup "TRY NOW FOR *price*". 

Example 4: Hootsuite.  No nav. Best value proposition "best way to manage social media" "hootsuite has the right solution for everyone" . Call to action: see our plans. Visual shows a dashboard of how things present. Next pages detail features, pricing models.
