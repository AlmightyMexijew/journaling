Good morning. Today we are going to take a small detour into the Mozilla documentation and run through their tutorials. I would like to refresh some things as well as try from a different angle.  At this point I have enough coding experience under my belt that it'll add and fill in the gaps that TOP and other project-oriented work have left in their rush.

We'll start from the very beginning to see what they have to say, and then take it from there. All files will be in the repo mozillatutorial.

Intro to HTML:
First interesting thing that I note is the emphasis on explaining attributes. I actually find this pretty great. I don't know that it's something to start with(maybe it is?) but as I've progressed I've found myself lacking the knowledge about how to make attributes work for me. This is nice.

One of the ones that is interesting is disabled="disabled" for turning off/graying out form options. Pretty cool and nifty to know.
Well..I got sidetracked and ended up spending time on my Russian on Duolingo, which led to me creating the tips.html and tips.css assets in /repos/russian .
