Back to JavaScript we go. Yesterday we began some more projects toward building a personal website. I'm paralyzed with indecision on a basic layout but after employing adobe color and something I learned from UI materials I see now the idea of using colors together. The color scheme came out very nice. My issue in part stems from need for images. I feel like I need images but I don't really have what to work with.  How does one effectively employ images to show web development skills? It's not like plumbers or handyman work or other things where you can provide tacit results.
