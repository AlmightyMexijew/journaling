Shavua tov. Today we settled some business with regard to the business side of things.  We also heard back from our prospective client D.  A few weeks ago, we presented him our project for the landing page that we created for his business (unasked for) and he was quite pleased with it. Unfortunately meeting has been difficult with his schedule and only now have I heard confirmation in the direction of setting a time and place.

What does D want? A basic poster-page type thing for advertising all around. That might be the work of a graphic designer instead of me...but..we can see.

He also wants a simple and basic website. He wasn't explicit as to what so we will have to talk about how "basic" that is.
