notes on flex-2-header
The first task I had to do was to make things go sideways. Given that there was a list, logo, list ordering I was able to use display: flex; to get it sideways.  After that, I needed to play around with the spacing of the units themselves (one,two, three and four,five,six).  I used gap and it cleanly divided them up. There was an issue however with the right margin between three and logo, so, I gave it a margin. This fixed the problem.

Next step from there was to shift Logo to be centered. I've tried align-content without success.

After reviewing the vlog The Odin Project VLOG | Day 22 CODING For BEGINNERS | Flex-Header CSS Exercise  by Jaybees Tech Talk:

I realized a few differences that needed making.  The first was to set justify-content:space-between to the header. This divided up things nicely-- before I could only get margins to push things roughly in a flimsy way toward center. 
The alignment of the logo itself I had align-self correct but I needed also to do justify-self:center to get the final result I was looking for.

By justifying content I didn't have to worry much about margins for up/down.  Space-between also was great for pushing things outward to have an equal space between them.

Ultimately I removed gap because justify-space-between was just fine for getting the same results.

His use of negative margin helped with the logo clinging to the left ul (so it could be shoved back with the justify-space-between).

The final solution:
They put display:flex; , align-items:center, and justify-content on header 
The also put ul to display flex and put margin and padding at 0; and then gap 8px.

Something interesting that he brings up:
margin and padding of 0 eliminates it. This was something I also had to play with. Apparently when we do that, it removes it, so the justifying stuff will calculate it all instead.
