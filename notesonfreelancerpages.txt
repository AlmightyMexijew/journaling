Method: Take 5-10 pages worth of freelancer homepages and analyze them
Collect what is common among them
Imitate and build that into structure

1) Zachary DuBow (www.zacharydubow.info).
*Nav-bar formed of container and sub-container divs in flex.
*Shows name | Past Work Skills Testimonials
*Right of this is a div for socials called social-nav. As expected, it produces us the various logos of social media like twitter.
*Far Right is a contact div. This pushes you to down in the page by id like wikipedia style sections.

Under the bar he has an intro. Fairly simple "Hi there, I'm Zach" and explanation of his creds. He offers 2 buttons here (Work With Me, See My Past Work) and has a picture next to it. Each button just invokes a page wiki-style like "Contact" up in nav.

He utilizes the same dark blue/white color scheme throughout the page, with only a handful of exceptions.

His next area is "Apps I've built". This is a section called "projects". Referrals built in take us here. He gives us 4 examples of his work (including github).

Next section is "Testimonials" and contains his testimonial and personal reference.

Next is section is "Skills".  He posts that he is a full stacker and gives a list of things he uses for his projects.

Next is "contact", where we were first referred to. Here there is a map of Israel pointing him as Jerusalem.  There is also a form here where he says he's happy to hear from us and he then again offers his social media contacts. The form he posted collects name/email/message and submits with a button.

For fun he put an API call of some kind that uses skyscanner... "Visit me in Israel".  It can be used to book flights.

"Summon Me" is an area beneath that which runs off something called calendly.  It allows for picking a day and time for a web conference call.  Pretty neat and definitely slick.

His ending is rather weird though: an old matrix picture with his name placed on top of it.  It seems relatively out of place compared to his very well designed and professional website.

Overall opinion: dude definitely has some skills.
